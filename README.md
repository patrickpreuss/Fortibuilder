# Fortibuilder
Tools that will eventually be released to help Administrators of Fortigate Firewalls.

Currently will convert Cisco ASA and portions of checkpoint configuration files, along with a generic parser to make objects from any .csv file. 

Still need to upload a bunch of fixes completed earlier. I would not suggest using it until then unless you know what you're doing.
